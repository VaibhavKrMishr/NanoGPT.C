# NanoGPT.C

**NanoGPT.C** is a minimal GPT-style transformer written in **pure C** â€” designed to help you understand the internals of language models and sharpen your systems programming skills.

## ðŸ§  Project Goal

Build a minimal, working version of a GPT-like transformer in **pure C** that can:

- ðŸ“¦ Load a tiny model (weights stored in a file or hardcoded)
- ðŸ¤– Perform inference (generate text from a prompt)

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Pure C (no external ML libraries)
- âœ… Character-level tokenizer (ASCII)
- âœ… Embeddings + Self-Attention + Feedforward layers
- âœ… Text generation with softmax sampling

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

- Learn GPT architecture step-by-step  
- Practice low-level memory and matrix operations in C  
- Build something functional with no dependencies
